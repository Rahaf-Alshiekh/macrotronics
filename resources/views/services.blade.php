                        <span class="li-title">Free Of Charge</span> - Macrotronics will maintain, repair and even replace
                        free of charge any equipment or
                        device purchased from its shops, provided it is still covered by the Warranty agreement. The free of
                        charge service also includes helpful guidelines and instructions on modes of usage. All Macrotronics
                        clients are entitled to get this service upon submission of the relevant product invoice, within

                <p>
                    The option of signing a Maintenance Contract guarantees you a safer working environment at a lower cost
                    and with a minimum to no downtime.

                    Why go for Contractual Maintenance? When you sign up for a maintenance contract your financial
                    advantages can be summarized in the fact that: a) your average yearly IT expenses would be lower than
                    they would be if you choose to pay for your repairs and setups on a case-by-case basis, and b) a fixed
                    annual rate makes budgeting easier.
